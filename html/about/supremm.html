<p><h1>SUPReMM Program</h1></p>
<br>
<p>The SUPReMM program is designed integrate job level performance data into the XDMoD framework so it is available for detailed analysis.  Initially an independently funded NSF program, SUPReMM was subsequently merged into the TAS program.  The goal of the SUPReMM program is to develop the HPCPerfStats other data sources and pipe this data into the XDMoD data warehouse.</p>
<p>HPCPerfStats uses collectors sampled at the beginning and end of every job and at regularly configured intervals to provide a wide variety of job performance information including memory, I/O file data, CPU data and network data.  Accordingly, with this data system personnel will have at their fingertips detailed performance data for every job that runs on the HPC resource.</p>
